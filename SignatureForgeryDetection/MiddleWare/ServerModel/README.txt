Inside the folder 'Models' there will be 3 more directories:
- ConvModel
- SiameseModel
- SSModel

In each directoy you will find a file with an extension of '.h5': that is the file that contains the model.
Also, you may find a file called 'classes.txt'. That file is imperative for both SSModel and ConvModel.
In it you will find the signers that were used to train the respective model.
