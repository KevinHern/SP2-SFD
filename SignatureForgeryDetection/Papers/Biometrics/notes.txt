Face Detection:
- Most use an AI supervised learning approach
- The core of these problems reside in image pre processing and feature extraction
- Image pre-processing techniques found:
	* Conversion of images to frequency space (to analyze brightness and other features)
	* Gabor Filters
		+ Band pass filtering
		+ Linear edge detection technique
		+ Used for detecting human expressions (sadness, smiling, winking, etc)
		+ Complex plane
- Classification Algorithms:
	* Linear Discriminant Analysis
	* NNets
		+ Feature Extraction:
			→ Convnets (no architecture displayed)
		+ Supervised Learning:
			→ MLFFNN = Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Nets (aka, dense nets)
		+ Unsupervised Learning:
			→ Siamese Networks
			→ Deep self-coding Network:
				* Collection of Restricted Boltzman Machines
	* Restricted Boltzman Machine
		+ Stochastic and generative neural networks
		+ Learn internal representations (probability distribution) 
		+ Represent and solve combinatoric problems.
		+ Architecture:
			* Free for all connections
			* All layers connected → share info at any given time
			* 2 Layered neural network (visible-hidden)
			* Stack of RBMs = Deep Belief Network but are replaced by GANs or Variational Autoencoders
- Decission methods:
	* Gradient Descent
	* Euclidean Distance (comparison based on distances)
	* Normalized Correlation (decision based on correlation score of features)
	* Softmax
- Observations:
	* A lot of encoders have been used (conv nets)
	* Issues: robustness & performance

Fingerprints
- Most use an AI supervised learning approach
- The core of these problems reside in image pre processing and feature extraction
- Image pre-processing techniques found:
	* Normalization (Limit values. Range of controlled values)
	* Fourier transform to enhance images (missing parts of the fingerprint)
	* Binarization: transformation to white and black without loosing information
	* Grayscale
	* Gabor Filter: remove noise + complex plane transformation
